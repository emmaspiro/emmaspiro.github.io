**Prospective students:** I typically recruit 1-2 new PhD students each year. I have a general policy not to speak to candidates in advance of the admissions process. This allows me to treat candidates equitably. I will reach out to candidates who apply to the UW Information Science PhD program and make our shortlist to discuss your research ideas and share more about our current research projects. 

In the meantime, you are in the right place to review recent publications and projects to help inform your research statement and other application materials. If you are interested in information integrity and manipulation, please also browse our work at the <a href="https://www.cip.uw.edu/">Center for an Informed Public</a>, which I co-founded in 2019. I currently serve as the CIP Director.
