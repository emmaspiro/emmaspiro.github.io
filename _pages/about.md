Dr. Emma S. Spiro's research involves the collection and analysis of large-scale social and behavioral data to answer key questions within the areas of sociology, information science, and social computing. Since early 2012, her work has focused on **understanding information-related behaviors in the context of crisis events**, including rumors, misinformation and collective sensemaking in online environments. Her work also explores the structure and dynamics of interpersonal and organizational networks in both online and offline environments.
