description: I have been honored to work with many students, researchers, postdoctoral scholars, and collaborators over the years.  >

**Prospective Students:** I typically recruit 1-2 new PhD students to my research group each year. I have a general policy not to speak to candidates in advance of the admissions process. This allows me to treat candidates equitably. I will reach out to candidates who apply to UW's Information Science PhD program and make our shortlist so that we can discuss your research ideas and I can share more about our current research projects. 

In the meantime, I encourage you to review recent publications and posts on my website to help inform your research statement and other application materials.
