**INFO 370 Core Methods in Data Science**

This course offers a practical, hands-on introduction to the basic Data Science methods. It covers data cleaning and filtering, introductory statistics, statistical inference and prediction, linear and logistic regression, prediction, and a few simple but essential machine learning techniques. Pre-requisites include basic understanding of statistics and experience with data programming.

**IMT 573 Data Science I - Theoretical Foundations**

The course provides an introduction to the foundational concepts and methods of data science, focusing on several critical skills, including data capture and transformation, probability and statistics, and data exploration and analysis. I am jointly responsible for the development of this course; I developed all current materials---slides, problem sets, and labs.

**IMT 571 Social Network Analysis**

This course offers students practical, hands-on instruction in common methods and analytical tools used for social network analysis. Students practice applying and interpreting network analysis methods to answer important questions within the social network domain. I am solely responsible for the development of this course, including slides, problem sets, labs, and exams.

**IMT 598 Problematic Information**

Addressing the problem of misinformation is among the most pressing challenges of our time -- and times to come. This graduate seminar will introduce students to the lexicon of problematic information, tracing the historical roots and context of this phenomena and exploring the new realm of online information operations employed in todayâ€™s socio-technical infrastructure. I am solely responsible for the development of this course. 

**IMT 578 / LIS 578 CIP Directed Research Group**

As part of the educational and research efforts of the Center for an Informed Public, I led a research seminar where students worked on CIP research projects, mentored by myself, CIP postdoctoral scholars, and other researchers. Topics included misinformation around COVID-19; synthetic media and the 2020 elections; designing a misinformation escape room; weaponized political narratives around the 2018 false missile alert and correction in Hawaii; and designing and populating a CIP data library.
