My research interests primarily lie in Misinformation & AI. I am interested in understanding and modeling the threats of geenrative models for disinformation operations. I am also interested in leveraging geenrative models for detecting and explaining misinformation and manipulation tactics.

My current research interests are a culmination of my previous research endeavours. In the Healthcare domain I was interested in addressing the problem of making medical data accesible to the public, without compromising privacy. At MSR, I was also interested in studying & characterizing the role of online influencers in spreading polarization, hate speech, & misinformation on social media platforms, particularly during political crises. I also worked on investigating interpretability and algorithmic fairness through the lens of causal inference.

In general, I am interested in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Social Computing, Human Computer Interaction, and Fairness & Explainability.
