    Sydney studies the influence of medium and opinion leaders on rumors, problematic information, and their diffusion. She specifically applies methods, concepts, and theories from network science to explore how medium and prominent actors interact to impact the mutability of information and cross-media information cascades. As a researcher with a relational view of the world, Sydney wants to understand how our social networks and information environments shape our epistemologies and behaviors.
