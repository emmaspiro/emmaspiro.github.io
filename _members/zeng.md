  Dr. Zeng develops theories and methods of the analysis of large-scale social data to better understand human behavior and improve social systems. Lying in the emerging field of computational social science, her work is rooted in social science theories and utilizes digital traces to test domain theories at scale providing novel insights. Her projects incorporate expertise in machine learning, social network analysis, and natural language processing. Part of her work studies how high-volume, dynamic, crisis-related informal online communication. This work sheds light on rumoring behavior during crisis events, as well as how the collective intelligence of the crowd can be utilized to distinguish misinformation and aid in its detection.
