    Kaylaâ€™s work aims to understand the impacts and utility of interventions designed to mitigate problems of misinformation and polarization in online information environments. She is particularly interested in how these issues are mediated by the systems and moderation actions deployed by social media platforms. Taking a computational social science approach, Kayla applies methods from network science, machine learning, and causal inference to understand and address societal issues.
