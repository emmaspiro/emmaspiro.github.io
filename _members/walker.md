  Dr. Walker's research focuses on two complementary areas: 1) new forms of political participation emerging on social media platforms and 2) the related challenges of collecting, analyzing, and preserving data from social media platforms. This work examines how new forms of political participation are emerging on social media platforms through the analysis of social media posts surrounding social movements, protests, and elections. Their work on social media methods also addresses gaps in our understanding about social media data, collection methods, and the implications (ethics, representation, etc.) of using those methods. Dr. Walker received their PhD in Information Science from the University of Washington Information School. They are a founding member of the Social Media (SoMe) Lab @ UW and a member of the DataLab. Dr. Walker also earned degrees in International Studies, and Liberal Studies, with a focus on public policy and technology, from Northern Kentucky University.
