    I research social media influencers, science communication, and right-wing extremism on social media using network science, machine learning, and mixed methods. I was advised by Kate Starbird and Emma S. Spiro. More specifically, I focus on understanding how different social media influencers in United States digital politics work together and against each other to produce the "news" we see online, with a particular emphasis on where this process breaks down. I have published first-author work in venues such as Science Advances, ICWSM, The Journal of Online Trust and Safety, AoIR, and others.
