    Dr. Register received their PhD as an NSF GRFP Fellow from the the University of Washington Information School. Their dissertation is entitled: "The Future of AI Can Be Kind: Strategies for Embedded Ethics in AI Education." Dr. Register studies ways that AI algorithms can cause harm, and the best practices for identifying and remedying such algorithmic harms. Their main focus is AI education – using trauma-informed computing to teach AI in empowering, inclusive, and supportive ways. Dr. Register studies the full life cycle of ML algorithms – from data collection to model selection to model evaluation and deployment; all with the goals of societal benefit and user safety and empowerment. From basic regression to large language models (LLMs), their goals are to quantify bias in the data and output, as well as identify potential harms that may come from the technology we create.
    When we create technology with compassion, we create a better world for everyone. Dr. Register has worked with RStudio, Code.org, MD4SG, and the Center for an Informed Public. They also do visiting talks and workshops, such as The Future of AI Can Be Kind or Mental Health, Social Media, and Empowerment. They often create educational resources and guest lecture on AI/ML topics.
