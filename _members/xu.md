I study how to leverage information and technology for social good, including (a) promoting health behaviors and improving health equity, (b) understanding selective exposure and reducing polarization, and (c) addressing problematic information. I conduct experiments, surveys, and content analyses by incorporating computational methods. My work appears in venues such as Health Communication, Political Communication, International Journal of Communication, Race and Social Problems, and ICWSM. I was awarded a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant (award #2242458) in Decision, Risk & Management Sciences from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for my dissertation. I also received a Top Paper Award and Annie Lang Outstanding Dissertation Award from the International Communication Association (ICA) Information Systems Division.

In Fall 2025, I will be joining University of Maryland (College Park, MD) College of Information (UMD iSchool) as a tenure-track Assistant Professor. I enjoy conducting research with diverse groups of researchers and I am always on the lookout for collaborators and students to work with - please feel free to reach out; Prospective PhD students can apply to UMD iSchool's PhD program.
