    Dr. Cesare is a research scientist at Boston Universityâ€™s School of Public Health.  They strive to create work that bridges data science and sociology.  Dr. Cesare draws heavily upon sociological theory in developing pathways for exploration, and find ways of using novel sources of social data to explore these trends.  

Much of her work leverages digital data - primarily, data from Twitter. Due to the richness of our digital lives, social data is everywhere.  It is her job as a sociologist to seek these data and translate them into beneficial insight for the social world. In doing so, Dr. Cesare explore the benefits and methodological/ethical challenges of conducting social research using data not designed with social researchers in mind.

In addition to exploring the use of digital data, Dr. Cesare am interested in how context influences wellness. Much of their teaching and research explores the spatial and social complexity of social determinants of health. Dr. Cesare works with investigators across disciplines in understanding how place and health are linked.
